== Installation ==

To install, simply upload the clickbump-seo.zip file via the WordPress Plugin installer and click "Activate". 
The plugin is now active and ready to use. If you downloaded this software from a bundle package, 
you will need to extract the clickbump-seo-files.zip to your desktop in order to locate the clickbump-seo.zip file.

NOTE: When you first install, ClickBump SEO!, you will see "Not Set" next to each of your posts and pages.
Once you have clicked publish on each of your posts, it will calculate the SEO! Score and register the target keyword phrase
for that page and it will update the "Not Set" value with the actual value extracted from the page.

== SEO! Settings panel ==

You can manage SEO! default settings under the WordPress dashboard's "Settings > SEO! Settings"
The plugin does not alter any of your content, it simply guides you on what to do in order to maximize each of your post's content to achieve the best on-page seo.

From the SEO! Settings page, you can customize the behavior of ClickBump SEO! in order to suit your specific site's setup. For example, If your active theme already assigns the post title to an h1 heading (as ClickBump Engine does), the plugin will automatically credit each post or page with the h1 setting.
