== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use a buy it now button? =

Currently this plugin does not support "buy it now" buttons

Currently this plugin does not provide that functionality. However, I do have plans to add the ability for multiple options and prices.

Make sure that the code specified in installation steps 4-7 in in place on your site.

= What if I get an error or the price or button does not show up? =

Make sure that you put a semi-colon after each value: [gtitle=my title; gprice=49.99;]

= Be sure not to use '$' for price ===

The price is a number, eventually I will strip out non-numbers, but that did not make it into this release.
