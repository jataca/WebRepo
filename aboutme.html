  <h1>About Me</h1>
</div>

<div class="display">
<h3>Hello everyone! My name is Jacob Casperson son of John Casperson. I am a Computer Science major with one <br>
  more semester after this one to graduate. I'm from Seattle, WA. and I love the pacific northwest. I used to <br>
  be a Seattle Sonics fan, but in 2002 I started watching the Seahawks religiously (once a week). I'm now a <br>
  huge Seahawks fan and attend their games whenever possible. I'm a competitive person and I love sports. <br>
  Whenever I have the chance I'll play football, basketball, soccer, baseball, volleyball, tennis, and hockey. <br>
  I also enjoy playing competitive computer games such as League of Legends and StarCraft. I really like to <br>
  support e-sports and I love to watch their games. Cloud 9 is my favorite LoL team and I don't really have <br>
  a favorite SC player, but I'll still watch it. I love resting, gardening, sleeping and eating. If I don't <br>
  get at least 7 hours of sleep at night I get very cranky. I don't believe in pointless meetings so if I <br>
  feel you're trying to get me to go to one I'll tell you I'm busy or that I'd rather take a nap and you <br>
  should take a hike. I used to like reading fantasy novels, but time doesn't really permit me to do that <br>
  I don't do it much anymore. I'm an introvert who can get sudden bursts of extrovertism, but for the most <br>
  part I just want to do my own thing. That's about it! </h3>
